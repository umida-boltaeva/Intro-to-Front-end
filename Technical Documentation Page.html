            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. <br />

                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and
                        page navigation.</li>

                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
